# Emitter

A port of NPM's
[Emitter](https://www.npmmjs.com/package/component-emitter), based on
IO and TVars.  The mixin feature was lost in translation.

Emitter is a simple publish/subscribe engine.

It's probably not the kind of thing you should use in the long run,
but it's got the same API, which I find rather handy as an
intermediate step while porting some JavaScript to Haskell.
